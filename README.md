# BudgetLog

## Inspiration
We spend lot of money for different expenses regularly. Huge amounts can be accounted for and will be remembered but small spendings on daily basis cannot be remembered and accounted for. Especially youth who have no experience in financial planning and spending often neglect to analyze where they are spending. We need a proper system to track all our minute expenses as well. At the same time, Cryptocurrency is gaining lot of potential and is proving to be trust worthy. With lot of attention around De-Fi and boom in crypto currency industry people are looking to enter this world. But, there is no proper standard way or tool to make transactions and view them in a simple layout. 

Budget Log solves this huge problem to track your expenses and serves as a bridge between Crypto markets and users of any level. **Especially for youth, in a generation where times are rapidly changing, learning how to properly budget and look after finances is of large importance. With this easy-to-use tracker, it is helping youth understand the importance of banking and financial planning.**

Budget Log solves this huge problem and serves as a bridge between Crypto markets and users of any level.
## What it does
Budget Log is a Web-App that helps you store all your Income and Expenditure details in one place along with Blockchain based Crypto transactions and Bill splitting in a user friendly interface. 

Main aim of Budget Log is to eliminate the hassle of checking complex and technical digital logs, records with a user friendly Layout to encourage people of all levels come and utilise the Crypto markets.

## How we built it
We have built it using Web stack like JavaScipt and HTML,CSS. The main frontend part is done by generating HTML through JS from database queries returned by Google Cloud. Bootstrap is used for styling. 

Blockchain based part is dependent on Ethereum network. We have used Matic network of Polygon to execute the transactions. JS and solidity is mainly used for this part.

Bill splitting feature is enabled with Javascript.
## Challenges we ran into
Main challenges include connecting the complex blockchain technology based transactions to our web-app and storing those details in our Ledger. We have gone through many tutorials for ethereum and finished it. We encountered lot of issues while implementing bill splitting feature using Smart COntract. We used both Smart contract and Javascript to finish this feature.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of the end product we made at the end. This is new for us using GCP and Firebase as Database and took some time to understand. End of the day the transactions are recorded into databse seamlessly which is a huge win for us.
## What we learned
We have mainly learned about how to transact with Crypto from any web-app and store the returned confirmations into Database.
## What's next for Budget Log
Budget Log is our First version where Transaction and storing of records is possible. We would like to extend this application to more crypto currency services like Lending and borrowing of Crytos with Uniswap or related De-Fi projects and also as mobile application for Android and iOS
